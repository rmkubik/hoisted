# Hoisted
HTML5 webgame using TypeScript and Phaser game framework written for Wizard Jam 5. One of the constraints of this game jam was to make use of only a single mechanic. This game is a puzzle platformer that utilizes throwing a bomb around the screen and having it propel your character around the screen to try and reach your objective.
